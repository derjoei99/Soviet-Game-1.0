# Soviet Union Game

**Welcome, comrade, to the Soviet Union Game!**  
An interactive historical game where your decisions shape the fate of Russia, the USSR, and the world. Will you lead the revolution to victory, remain neutral and watch chaos unfold, or oppose the Bolsheviks and forge a completely new future? The choice is yours, but beware—history, a fragile thing, and some events, like Austrian painter with tiny mustache, poor JFK’s tragic fate, and a 9/11-like event: inevitable.

## Bigger Intro: A Glimpse Into the Game
**"Welcome, comrade, to the year 1917!"**  
Mother Russia stands at a crossroads. The Tsar’s empire crumbles, its people starve, and its soldiers are worn down by the horrors of the Great War. Across the land, cries for revolution rise: "Enough!" The future of Russia lies in your hands, comrade. Will it fall into chaos, rise as a force for the people, or take another path entirely?  

But remember, history is never confined to one nation. Beyond Russia’s borders, the world is at war, and new forces are taking shape. A strange Austrian painter with a tiny mustache dreams of his own rise to power. Far away, across the Atlantic, the seeds of an idealized American hero are being sown. And no matter what path you take, history's dramatic twists—like JFK’s assassination and a 9/11-like tragedy—refuse to be undone.  

In this game, you will guide Russia through the storms of revolution. Will you support the call for socialism and help create a powerful Soviet Union? Will you stand aside, letting history unfold in chaos? Or will you fight against the tide, opposing revolution and forging an alternate future?  

Your decisions will shape not only the future of Russia but the world itself. History waits for no one, comrade. The revolution begins now—prepare yourself!
